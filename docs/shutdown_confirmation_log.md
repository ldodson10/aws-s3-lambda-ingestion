# AWS Infrastructure Shutdown Confirmation Log  
**Author:** Latrisha Dodson  
**Project:** AWS S3 + Lambda Ingestion (SIEMless Integration)  
**Date:** October 8, 2025

## Purpose
This document confirms the safe termination of all AWS resources used during the development and testing of the S3 + Lambda ingestion pipeline. The goal was to prevent AWS charges beyond the Free Tier and ensure all compute, storage, and event services were removed.

## Actions Performed

### Terraform Cleanup
- Executed `terraform destroy` from:

- Terraform output:

- Verified no residual state resources using:

→ No tracked resources found.

### Manual AWS Console Cleanup
| Service | Actions Taken | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **S3** | Deleted all buckets prefixed with `lambda-ingest-bucket-` | ✅ Complete |
| **Lambda** | Removed `S3IngestHandler` and test functions | ✅ Complete |
| **EventBridge** | Deleted rules triggering from S3 → Lambda | ✅ Complete |
| **IAM** | Removed custom roles & policies (`LambdaS3IngestRole`, `lambda_exec_role`) | ✅ Complete |
| **GuardDuty** | Disabled detector instance and deleted findings | ✅ Complete |
| **CloudWatch** | Deleted all log groups associated with Lambda tests | ✅ Complete |
| **VPC** | Verified `siem-main-vpc` and associated resources removed | ✅ Complete |

### Verification
- **Terraform state:** No managed resources.  
- **AWS Console checks:** No active S3 buckets, Lambdas, or VPCs found.  
- **Billing → Free Tier Usage:** All usage within Free Tier; no cost accrued.

---

### Notes
- `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` removed locally.  
- Billing alerts remain active in CloudWatch to detect any unexpected usage.  
- Documentation and architecture diagrams preserved for project continuity.

---

### Summary
All infrastructure related to the AWS S3 + Lambda ingestion pipeline has been successfully destroyed.  
**No active AWS services remain** that could generate costs.  
This environment is now considered safe for archival and future redeployment testing.
